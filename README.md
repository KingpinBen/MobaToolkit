Some tools in making some of the core parts to a MOBA

I've recently added before I headed off on holiday but hopefully I've not left anything out. There's a lot more unfinished stuff in a worse state but I figured I'd leave you with this as it 'works'. There are a few changes that I want to make though, specifically regarding the Fog and its data.
I'm also still unsure on whether I want to stick with UNet, as this project initially just started as I wanted to explore the new features.
